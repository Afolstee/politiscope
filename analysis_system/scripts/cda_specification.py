# AI Prompt for Building Critical Discourse Analysis Software

## System Prompt for AI Developer

You are tasked with building a comprehensive Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) software system. This system should analyze texts for power relations, ideological implications, and social inequality markers using Fairclough's three-dimensional framework.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Three-Dimensional Analysis Framework

**Build modules for:**

**A. Text Analysis Module**
- Lexical analysis for ideologically loaded words
- Grammatical analysis (passive/active voice, nominalization, modality)
- Semantic analysis for implicit meanings and presuppositions
- Cohesion and coherence patterns
- Intertextual reference detection

**B. Discursive Practice Module**
- Genre identification and convention analysis
- Production context inference
- Distribution channel analysis
- Consumption pattern prediction
- Intertextuality mapping

**C. Social Practice Module**
- Power relation identification
- Ideological positioning detection
- Social group representation analysis
- Inequality marker identification
- Hegemonic discourse recognition

### 2. Core CDA Features to Implement

**Ideological Analysis:**
\`\`\`python
# Detect ideological patterns:
- Individualism vs collectivism markers
- Neoliberal discourse indicators
- Nationalist rhetoric patterns
- Gender/race/class positioning
- Authority legitimation strategies
